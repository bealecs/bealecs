### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a junior developer passionate about learning, teaching, and building. I have a background in IT, with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've been passionate about programming since I was a teen and am excited to continue learning.

I spent four years in the Air Force as an avionics journeyman before leaving the service to chase my dreams. Since then, I've completed online certificates through Coursera and Codecademy that have helped me increase my knowledge of web development skills. Most recently, I've completed the META React Front-end Developer Course Certificate path at Coursera to understand web development and programming better. I've also been accepted into #VetsWhoCode to learn and grow with an organization that trains veterans and military space.

I have created a professional portfolio to display my skillsets a little better, which can be found @ https://clifcodes.netlify.app

I'd love to connect if you're interested in furthering your education or want someone else who loves learning!
